Kindergarten sues TEPCO for damages

Jiji Press

A kindergarten has sued Tokyo Electric Power Co. for 420 million yen in damages, claiming that the crisis at the utility's Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant forced the institution to halt its operations.

The lawsuit was filed by Oya Gakuen, located in the town of Namie, Fukushima Prefecture, about nine kilometers from the TEPCO plant. It is within the no-entry zone.

In the first hearing of the case at the Tokyo District Court on Wednesday, TEPCO indicated it would reject the claim for damages.

Oya Gakuen planned to open a new facility combining the functions of a kindergarten and a nursery in April last year. A nursery had already been built next to the kindergarten.

In the lawsuit, the kindergarten said its 2,000-square-meter site and the newly constructed nursery building were now worthless because of contamination from radioactive substances.

The amount of damages sought includes compensation for the loss in the value of the property and the cost of opening the nursery building.
