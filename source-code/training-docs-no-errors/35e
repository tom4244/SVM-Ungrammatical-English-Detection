People wait to enter Mitsui Outlet Park Kisarazu in Kisarazu, Chiba Prefecture, on Friday.

Mitsui Outlet Park Kisarazu opened Friday near the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line Kisarazu-Kaneda Interchange in Kisarazu, Chiba Prefecture. There are currently 171 shops and the outlet park is expected to expand to between 200 and 250 to become the largest outlet mall in the country.

According to Mitsui Fudosan Co., the developer, the site area is about 215,000 square meters, 4.5 times the size of Tokyo Dome. All buildings are one-story and the grounds are landscaped with palm trees. International brand names such as Burberry and Coach and other shops have opened branches at the mall.

More than 2,000 people lined up Friday morning for the opening. Mayu Takeda, 29, from Kawasaki said, "As it's near the ocean, I expect there will be a different atmosphere from other outlet parks."
