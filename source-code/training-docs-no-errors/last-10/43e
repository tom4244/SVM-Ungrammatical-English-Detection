'Drive' brings back film noir, gritty action

Drive

Dir: Nicolas Winding Refn

Cast: Ryan Gosling, Carey Mulligan, Oscar Isaac

You never learn the past, or even the name, of the protagonist in director Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive. Even so, Ryan Gosling delivers a great performance as a man who gives off the mythical aura of a silver-screen hero.

By day, the nameless man (Gosling) works as a stuntman. By night, he's a getaway driver. A calm man of few words, he accomplishes his missions one by one with mechanical efficiency. However, when he falls in love with Irene (Carey Mulligan), a married woman living in the same apartment building, he gets dragged into horribly violent circumstances.

Similar to the 1978 film The Driver by director Walter Hill, Drive could be considered film noir, a genre of classic crime dramas. But where The Driver is a dark film noir, Drive has a warmer feel. This could be because Refn, who is colorblind, uses his unique sense of color hues in his cinematography. The story also focuses on its more romantic elements.

Shot in a mystic, neon Los Angeles, Drive's car chases are different from the typical flashy action sequence in recent movies. Sometimes, the driver hides in the dark, fending off the car behind him. The next moment he hits the accelerator. The contrast between tranquility and action is perfectly balanced in the film.

Neither the driver nor Irene says much. They just look into each other's eyes and smile. In one particularly romantic scene, the driver, Irene and her son take a drive together in the sun.

The director cuts out extra explanations and instead, skillfully uses pauses to tell a story. In between these silent moments, are sudden flashes of piercing, extremely graphic violence.

In Drive, Refn has total control of the film's speed. It runs straight to the end, entertaining the audience with something only found in great movies.

The movie is now playing.
