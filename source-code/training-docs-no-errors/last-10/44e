Simple days

Unlike the bizarre pop fashions usually seen on runways in Tokyo, the latest collections for the 2012/13 Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Tokyo held between March 18 and 24 were rather quiet, focusing more on chic and simple designs.

Drawing on the force of nature demonstrated by the Great East Japan Earthquake, many designers embraced the theme of "coexistence" at the event, held a year after the massive earthquake and tsunami.

Somarta used the colors and shapes of shells and coral in its line. Models appeared in dresses covered with tape-like strips of fabric, and vivid red and light pink were the dominant hues of the collection.

The theme of Kamishima Chinami was a winter forest. "I want the audience to feel vitality and strength in the time before spring," said designer Chinami Kamishima, who used tree branch and cyclamen flower motifs on her feminine one-piece dresses.

Christian Dada, well-known for designing costumes for pop diva Lady Gaga, also presented a collection inspired by a forest--but one that is devastated, not vibrant. Designer Masanori Morikawa was influenced by footage shown on TV after the March 11 disaster of a forest contaminated by the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear catastrophe.

For example, the designer re-created a blueish green, mossy forest using a uniquely woven fabric on a miniskirt.

"I want to ask my audience a question through my designs about the future of nature in Japan," he said.

In contrast, a tropical mood dominated beautiful people's runway, with Hawaiian flowers, palm trees and pineapples printed on scarves and jackets.

"I was inspired by a tropical island, as I hope my clothes make wearers happy and joyful," said designer Hidenori Kumakiri.

The autumn/winter collection of matohu illustrated the change of the season through its designs. Hiroyuki Horihata and Makiko Sekiguchi boldly sketched random patterns on silk dresses with brushes, evoking autumn in mustard yellow and navy blue.

The duo processed luxury silk to make it look and feel like hemp, and melted part of the textile to make rough holes exposing the back fabric. By putting detailed work into the fabric, the designers expressed the Japanese value of "exploring beauty from something simple."

"After the earthquake, I felt consumers wanted clothes to be simpler, to express richness of mind rather than something gaudy and luxurious," Horihata said.

The latest shows contain designers' answers to a question that emerged after the quake: "What is the purpose of clothing and design?"
