Internet radio makes local issues global

I recently become aware of the nation's various community radio stations where one can hear marvelous dialects and unique programs from regions such as Tohoku or Kansai.

This is possible due to the Internet.

Every morning I switch on my PC and access a radio service called Saimaru Rajio (Simul Radio). On the central homepage are listed around 30 such radio stations available across the nation. The service uses the word, Simul, for simultaneous, as they broadcast not only to their respective local areas, but also literally worldwide via Internet streaming.

After surfing through several radio stations, I usually end up listening to the broadcast emanating from my home turf--Miyazaki Prefecture--called Miyazaki Sunshine FM.

The service started in February 1999 as the prefecture's first community FM station. In keeping with other similar stations across the country, it was established to convey information pertinent to the everyday lives of people in the community. Such stations also can play a crucial role in emergency cases and natural disasters.

Miyazaki Sunshine FM joined the simultaneous radio service in December last year. Before then, the station only catered to the 450,000 people in and around the Miyazaki area. The station's audience now extends far beyond the prefecture. Even in the local areas, the station is serving listeners more effectively, as many people could not get a clear signal due to their remote location or obstruction by tall buildings.

"Judging from the requests, calls and faxes we receive, we have regular listeners in places as far away as Hokkaido and the Kanto region. Earlier this month, a listener from Tokyo dropped into our office during a visit to Kyushu," the FM station's head of sales, Tsugio Hidaka, told me.

Among the station's various programs, I particularly enjoy the live morning section called Morning Sunshine, in which the host--who is well acquainted with the various Miyazaki dialects--asks questions about a particular dialect of the area. Do you know the meaning of words such as "nanton-shiren," "aba" and "ando-suru"? They mean "silly," "brand-new" and "get tired," respectively. For example, if during my time at middle school I had asked a friend how he liked my new joke, he would likely have dismissed it by saying "It's nanton-shiren."

Each time I hear such words I somehow feel happy. Actually, I have not used them myself or heard them said for a very long time.

During the program, listeners often give their reaction to the quiz. I can easily imagine how difficult it must be for listeners outside the prefecture--especially outside Kyushu--to understand such vocabulary. But this surely is a good way for people to get to know and understand the region.

The Miyazaki Sunshine FM radio station is located on the third floor of a building in the center of the city. Last Friday, I was allowed a glimpse of a live broadcast. Asei Tajima, 32, and Mayu Kobayashi, 25, were the hosts of the day. Their rhythmic and sprightly chat not only complemented the music but also the fledgling world of Internet broadcasting. However, their speech bore no traces of a Miyazaki accent.

Among the aforementioned 30 radio stations there likely are sources of interest and pleasure for many readers of this newspaper. Such stations doubtless have more flexibility in running their daily programs and can talk more freely with guests compared with other traditional mediums. Even the relating of a local legend as told by an elderly resident of the area--which I happen to hear from time to time--is worthwhile listening to.
