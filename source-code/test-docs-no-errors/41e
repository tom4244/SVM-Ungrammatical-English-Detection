NATURE IN SHORT / Sashiba birds increasingly at risk as number of prey declining

Kevin Short / Daily Yomiuri Columnist

It looks like the long winter is finally over. Out here in the rice paddy countryside of northern Chiba Prefecture, the someiyoshino cherry blossoms are finally coming into bloom.

This year, the blooming succession has been severely compacted. Normally, wild camellias, ume plums, kobushi magnolias, someiyoshino and wild cherries would open up in turn over the course of a long, drawn-out spring. This week, however, I can see all these flowers in bloom at the same time.

The local farmers are hard at work preparing rice paddies for transplanting. First the paddies are turned over, then the aze dikes, which separate the paddies and keep the water in, must be sealed by plastering with a new coat of mud. This process is called kuronure, or "black plastering." In the past, it was a very labor-intensive, time-consuming task that could only be done by hand with a hoe. These days, however, amazing new tractor attachments are available that automatically push up the soil and pack it down tightly at the perfect angle.

Japanese farmers deeply appreciate this type of new labor-saving device. On many farms, the young people have taken salaried jobs, and only an elderly couple is left to work the fields. Almost all Japanese farms are family-owned, and the small plots simply do not produce enough revenue to hire laborers. Where I live and work, many of the smaller, less-productive paddies have already been abandoned, and have reverted to reed marsh. Many more will be abandoned as soon as the current elderly cultivators retire.

Farmers that persevere are hard-pressed to keep up with the work. Much of the process of preparing, planting and harvesting the paddies is now automated, but weeding the aze dikes and roadside banks is still a problem. Gasoline-powered string-cutters are the best tool currently available, but even these involve long hours of tough work. As a result, more and more farmers now opt to simply spray the areas with powerful herbicides.

The aze dikes and the banks surrounding the paddies are key environments in the countryside ecosystem. Traditionally cut two or three times per year, these areas provide ideal habitat for small, fast-growing wildflowers, such as beautiful purple-blue fude-rindo (Gentiana zollingeri) and koke-rindo (G. squarrosa) gentians and amana edible tulips (Tulipa edulis), to flourish.

Various types of insects, especially herbivorous grasshoppers, also thrive on well-maintained aze dikes. These attract frogs and lizards, which in turn attract snakes. Reptiles and amphibians are among the favorite prey of the sashiba, or gray-faced buzzard-eagle. These medium-size birds of prey nest in tall coniferous trees on the valley slopes. They hunt during the day, using their keen eyes to spot small animals moving on the ground.

Sashiba spend the winter months in the warmer areas of Southeast Asia. Some also winter in southern Okinawa Prefecture. Come spring they migrate northward to their breeding grounds, which include Japan, the Korean Peninsula and parts of the Asian mainland. In recent years, the number of these birds has been declining sharply here in Japan. Although not yet considered endangered on a worldwide level, in the national Red Data Book prepared by the Environment Ministry, they are listed as VU, or vulnerable to extinction (zetsumetsu kigu II).

In the Chiba prefectural Red Data Book, the sashiba is listed as A rank, the category that denotes the most highly endangered species. Here the raptor depends heavily on the countryside landscape, and is thus easily influenced by changes in the agricultural sector.

When rice paddies or vegetable fields are abandoned, they quickly revert to their original vegetation, marshland in the case of paddies and secondary woodlands in the case of the vegetable fields. While these changes may actually benefit some species, they are highly disadvantageous to the sashiba. Both the marshes and woodlands are covered with dense vegetation, which makes it difficult for the buzzard-eagles to spot prey moving on the ground.

Aze dikes and banks that have been sprayed with herbicides are open habitats, but their disrupted ecosystem does not support a heavy population of insects and small animals. These areas thus offer up little prey for the sashiba.

In the southern Kanto region, the sashiba has adapted to take advantage of the traditional countryside landscape. With very little untouched natural environments remaining, many other species in this area also depend heavily on the same landscape. Even small changes in the landscape can thus have enormous effects on regional biodiversity and ecosystems.

This is an extremely delicate and difficult issue to deal with. The farmers, who are simply struggling to survive in an unfavorable social and economic environment, cannot be held at fault. Even as a dedicated ecologist and nature conservationist, I would be totally out of line to ask them to risk their livelihood for the sake of preserving biodiversity.

The best way to solve this dilemma would be with a strong, well-funded environmental stewardship program. Appropriate financial incentives should be made available to farmers who engage in inefficient but ecologically valuable agricultural practices, such as cutting the weeds on aze dikes and banks.
