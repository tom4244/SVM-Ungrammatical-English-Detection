Kyushu Shinkansen train services will be able to cover the full length of Kyushu when a new building at Hakata Station opens in spring 2011.

Flying over the mountains of Kyushu from Miyazaki to Fukuoka, I'm always impressed by the verdancy and simple beauty of the island. Yes, maybe we need more flat plains for people to live on, but I'll opt for the status quo in this case. Kyushu's residents enjoy a quiet life amid the combination of its rich nature and mild weather, with the exception of the typhoons during summer and autumn.

Of course, being far from the national capital has often been a disadvantage.

Look at the road and railway systems. We are finally seeing the last stage of the construction of the Kyushu Shinkansen train. By connecting Shin-Yatsushiro in Kumamoto Prefecture with Hakata Station in Fukuoka, we will be able to travel from Hakata to Kagoshima-Chuo Station in Kagoshima in just 1 hour and 20 minutes, and from Shin-Osaka to Kagoshima-Chuo in about four hours in the spring of 2011.

Nonetheless, Kyushu's geographical location is a beneficial factor these days. As Kyushu is often referred to as a gateway to Asia, there are positive signs in the economical indexes.

According to the Kyushu Economic Research Center in Fukuoka, there are now 27 airline routes connecting Asian cities with Kyushu, if we include Yamaguchi Prefecture that is just across the narrow Kanmon Strait. Kyushu also has 113 international cargo routes, mainly with Asia.

Thanks to these stronger ties with the Asia region, the center expects Kyushu's economy to grow by 1.3 percent in fiscal 2010 after three years of stagnation. One major factor behind this is the growth of exports to developing nations in Asia, especially China.

"As Kyushu has factories in the iron, chemical, semiconductor and auto industries, the recovery in the Asian market has direct positive effects," said Naoto Takaki, director of the center.

Kyushu is an economic powerhouse, with a gross domestic product that, including Okinawa Prefecture, represents about 10 percent of the national total--in fiscal 2006, Kyushu's GDP was valued at 51.9 trillion yen, or about 9.2 percent of that of the nation as a whole. As a result, it is usually called ichi-wari keizai (10 percent economy). Kyushu's GDP is comparable to some European nations.

Kyushu boasts thriving agriculture and fishery industries, accounting for about 20 percent of the nation's revenue from farm products. But even so, Takaki felt that "in reality, we're not making the best use of our geographical advantages. We have so much to offer our Asian neighbors."

"One example is environmentally friendly technology. However, overseas start-ups by Kyushu firms account for only 4 percent of the total for Japanese firms," he pointed out.

Tourism is another bright spot. About 1 million foreign tourists visit Kyushu annually. Of these, 60 percent come from South Korea. It is common to find people from South Korea playing golf or visiting a hot spring in the region these days, although tourism has dropped off somewhat due to the strong yen and weak won.

We will see more Chinese tourists this year, according to the center. Last year about 70,000 Chinese tourists are believed to have visited Kyushu, including 30,000 passengers who arrived on 24 cruise ships. This year the number of cruise ship visits is expected to jump to 66 with 80,000 visitors on board.

I recently met a village mayor in Miyazaki Prefecture who said he was trying to attract Chinese visitors to his village from Fukuoka via the Kyushu Highway, saying the village can offer attractions different from those in other parts of the country.

One U.S. magazine ran a special advertising section on Kyushu last year titled "Gateway to Prosperity." After introducing Kyushu's various merits, including its dynamic industries and resorts, it closed with these encouraging words, "Kyushu is one little island that is ready to take on the world and win."

I hope so. As Kyushu prospers, it will be a good example for other regions in this country.
